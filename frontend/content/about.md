# About Us

## Who We Are

We’re Ben & Tom, the directors of **NextSteps Digital & Web**, a business dedicated to empowering small businesses and charities to take their next steps into the digital world. Based in Gloucester, we proudly serve customers across the UK, delivering tailored digital solutions designed to expand customer bases and help businesses grow.

## Our Vision

Our vision is simple yet impactful: to make digital services accessible for small businesses and charities, helping them establish an online presence, connect with their audience, and unlock their true potential. We bring passion, expertise, and a customer-focused approach to every project, ensuring your success is our priority.

## Our Journey

Our journey began in 2020 when we adopted Luna, our beloved dog, from a Cheltenham-based charity. Inspired by their mission, we started volunteering to enhance their online presence. What began as updating their website evolved into managing social media, finding innovative ways to raise funds, and increasing their visibility. 

Redesigning their website to better showcase their work was a rewarding experience, and it highlighted the need for accessible digital services for organisations with limited technical resources. This rewarding experience laid the foundation for what would become NextSteps Digital & Web.

## Helping Businesses Thrive

Through word of mouth, we were introduced to a care brokerage business seeking to establish its online presence. We built a bespoke website, created custom mailing services with a unique domain, and set up their online profiles. To drive growth, we implemented SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) features, helping local clients find their services, and launched marketing campaigns to enhance their visibility. 

Seeing the tangible impact of our work inspired us to extend our services nationwide, supporting small businesses and charities with affordable, flexible, and high-quality digital solutions.

## Our Commitment to Small Businesses

At **NextSteps Digital & Web**, we understand the unique challenges small businesses face. That’s why our pricing is designed with flexibility in mind—no extreme price models, just a pay-as-you-go structure that adapts to your needs. We’re here to make the digital world more accessible, one small business at a time.
